ENTPD1_ML: Machine Learning for Prognosis in People Living with HTLV
This repository contains Python scripts for implementing various Machine Learning models aimed at predicting prognosis in People Living with HTLV.

Project Structure
The project is initially divided into four main scripts:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- Model Selection and Optimization: Defining and optimizing machine learning models.
- Model Performance Evaluation: Assessing the predictive capability of the models.
- Explainable AI (XAI) Application: Applying XAI techniques to interpret the model's predictions.


Notes & Reminders
Clinical data has been excluded since it is yet to be extracted from medical records.
Once available, oligosymptomatic patients will be classified separately to enhance model performance.
Environment & Dependencies
The code was developed using the following versions:


Python version: 3.11.7
  
Libraries:  
- scikit-learn: 1.2.2  
- imbalanced-learn: 0.12.1  
- scikit-optimize: 0.10.1  
Dataset Information
The dataset used is named: cat2_df_clinic_ENTPD1.csv.
